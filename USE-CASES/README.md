## Possible Use Cases - Brainstorming

### Onboarding 

#### Discovery of Directory
When onboarding a device, the device may need to discover the directory service to register with.

#### Discovery of Devices by Onboarding Tool
In OCF, "unowned" devices in a special "onboarding" state can be discovered by an onboarding tool and provisioned with keys.

### Peer-to-Peer
Have an existing IoT installation.  While physically present or near the device, or on the same local network, 
want to find out what I can do with it using a browser or another tool.

### Plant Automation
Have a set of devices in an installation, and want to survey what devices exist and what can be done with them,
what capilities they support, with the goal of automating activities.
I may also be interested in services that use these devices, so may want to do a kind of "reverse lookup".

### Cloud Services
I want to know what devices and services are accessible from a certain cloud provider or service.

### Smart City Services

#### As a Visitor
As a visitor to a city, I want to know what services are available in a certain location, using my mobile device.

#### As a Citizen
As a citizen of a city, I want to know what services are available generally, using my mobile device or some other client.

#### Remote Query
From a remote location, I would like to access data provided by a city for planning purposes (e.g. planning a trip,
ecological studies, etc.).  Relates to support of open data portal.
