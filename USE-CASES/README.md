Have an existing IoT installation.  While physically present or near the device, or on the same local network, 
want to find out what I can do with it using a browser or another tool.

### Plant Automation
Have a set of devices in an installation, and want to survey what devices exist and what can be done with them,
what capilities they support, with the goal of automating activities.
I may also be interested in services that use these devices, so may want to do a kind of "reverse lookup".
