        <p>The W3C Web of Things (WoT) is intended to enable
            interoperability across IoT platforms and application
            domains.
            Overall, the goal of the WoT is to preserve and complement existing
            IoT standards and solutions. In general, the W3C WoT architecture is 
            designed to describe what exists rather than to prescribe
            what to implement.

        <h1>Terminology</h1>
        <p>This specification uses the following terms as defined here.
           The WoT prefix is used to avoid ambiguity for terms that are
           (re)defined specifically for Web of Things concepts.</p>
        <dl>
            <dt><dfn data-lt="WoT Discovery">Discovery</dfn>
            </dt>
            <dd>In the WoT context, the process of finding and retrieving Thing metadata
            in the form of Thing Descriptions for Things satisfying some criteria of interest.
            </dd>
            <dt><dfn data-lt="WoT Exploration">Exploration</dfn>
            </dt>
            <dd>A discovery mechanism that provides access to detailed metadata in the 
            form of one or more Thing Descriptions.  Exploration mechanisms are in
            general protected by security mechansism and are accessible only to authorized users.
            </dd>
            <dt><dfn data-lt="WoT Introduction">Introduction</dfn>
            </dt>
            <dd>A "first contact" discovery mechanism, whose result is a URL that
            references an exploration mechanism.  Introduction mechanisms themselves
            should not directly provide metadata, and in general are designed to be 
            open.
            </dd>
            <dt><dfn data-lt="WoT Thing Description Directory">Thing Description Directory (TDD)</dfn>
            </dt>
            <dd>A directory service with a prescribed API that allows the 
            registration, management, and search of a database of Thing Descriptions.
            Note that the acronym should be TDD, not TD, to avoid confusion with Thing Descriptions (TDs).

               A GET on all such URLs MUST result in a TD.
               For self-describing Things, this can be the TD of the Thing itself.
               If the URL references a Directory, this MUST be the TD of the
               Directory service.
               A Directory can be distinguished from a Thing by the use of an
               <code>@type</code> including the semantic term <code>WoT-Directory</code>.

            Security and privacy are a cross-cutting issues that need to be considered

                building blocks</a> and WoT implementations. This chapter
            summarizes some general issues and guidelines to help
            preserve the security and privacy of concrete WoT discovery implementations.
