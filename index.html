    <section id="abstract">
        <p>The W3C Web of Things (WoT) is intended to enable
           interoperability across IoT platforms and application
           domains.  One key mechanism for accomplishing this goal
           is the definition and use of metadata describing the
           interactions an IoT device or service makes available
           over the network at a suitable level of abstraction.  
           The WoT Thing Description specification satisfies this objective.
        </p>
        <p>However, in order to use a Thing its Thing Description
           first has to be obtained.  The <em>WoT Discovery</em> process described 
           in this document addresses this problem.
           WoT Discovery needs to support the distribution of WoT Thing Descriptions
           in a variety of use cases.  This includes ad-hoc and engineered systems;
           during development and at runtime; and on both local and global networks.
           The process also needs to work with existing discovery mechanisms,
           be secure, protect private information, and be able to efficiently
           handle updates to WoT Thing Descriptions and the 
           dynamic and diverse nature of the IoT ecosystem.
        </p>
        <p>The WoT Discovery process is divided into two phases,
           Introduction, and Exploration.  The Introduction phase 
           leverages existing discovery mechanisms but does not directly
           expose metadata; they are simply used to discover Exploration
           services, which provide metadata but only after secure authentication
           and authorization.  This document normatively defines two Exploration
           services, one for WoT Thing self-description with a single 
           WoT Thing Description and a searchable WoT Thing Directory
           service for collections of Thing Descriptions.
           A variety of Introduction services are also described and where
           necessary normative definitions are given to support them.

            form of one or more Thing Descriptions.  Exploration mechanisms are in
            general protected by security mechansism and are accessible only to authorized users.

                    <h4>Search</h4>
                    <p>Sub-API to search a directory, e.g. issue a query.
                    There are different forms and levels of query possible, for example,
                    syntactic (JSONPath, XPath) vs. semantic (SPARQL), 
                    and the more advanced query types may not be 
                    supported by all directories.   
                    So this API will have further subsections,
                    some of which will be optional.
                    Search also includes a sub-API for managing listing the contents (eg returned by
                    a query) including handling pagination, etc.
                    Note that one special form of query will be able to return everything.
                    Results may be subject to the requestor's authorization.

        <h1>Security and Privacy Considerations</h1>
        <p>
            Security and privacy are cross-cutting issues that need to be considered
            in all <a href="#sec-building-blocks">WoT
                building blocks</a> and WoT implementations. This chapter
            summarizes some general issues and guidelines to help
            preserve the security and privacy of concrete WoT discovery implementations.
            For a more detailed and complete analysis of security and
            privacy issues, see the <em>WoT Security and Privacy Guidelines</em>
            specification [[?WOT-SECURITY]].
