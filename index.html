        <p>The W3C Web of Things (WoT) is intended to enable
            interoperability across IoT platforms and application
            domains.
            Overall, the goal of the WoT is to preserve and complement existing
            IoT standards and solutions. In general, the W3C WoT architecture is 
            designed to describe what exists rather than to prescribe
            what to implement.

        <h1>Security and Privacy Considerations</h1>
        <p>
            Security and privacy are a cross-cutting issues that need to be considered
            in all <a href="#sec-building-blocks">WoT
                building blocks</a> and WoT implementations. This chapter
            summarizes some general issues and guidelines to help
            preserve the security and privacy of concrete WoT discovery implementations.
            For a more detailed and complete analysis of security and
            privacy issues, see the <em>WoT Security and Privacy Guidelines</em>
            specification [[?WOT-SECURITY]].

        <h1>Acknowledgments</h1>
        <p>Special thanks to X, Y, and Z
           for their contributions to this document.
        </p>
        <p>
            Many thanks to the W3C staff and all other active Participants of the W3C Web
            of Things Interest Group (WoT IG) and Working Group (WoT WG) for their
            support, technical input and suggestions that led to improvements to
            this document.
        </p>
        <p>The WoT WG also would like to appreciate the pioneering efforts
           regarding the concept of "Web of Things" that started as an academic
           initiative in the form of publications such as [[?WOT-PIONEERS-1]] [[?WOT-PIONEERS-2]]
           [[?WOT-PIONEERS-3]] [[?WOT-PIONEERS-4]] and, starting
           in 2010, a yearly <a href="https://webofthings.org/events/wot/">
           International Workshop on the Web of Things</a>.</p>
           <p>Finally, special thanks to Joerg Heuer for leading the WoT IG for 2 years 
            from its inception and guiding the group to come up with the concept of 
            WoT building blocks including the Thing Description.</p>
